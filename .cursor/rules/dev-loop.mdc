# Development Process

## 1. Start with Formatting

Format your code first:

```
uv run ruff format .
```

## 2. Run Tests

Verify that your changes pass the tests:

```
uv run py.test
```

## 3. Commit Initial Changes

Make an atomic commit for your changes using conventional commits.
Use `@git-commits.mdc` for assistance with commit message standards.

## 4. Run Linting and Type Checking

Check and fix linting issues:

```
uv run ruff check . --fix --show-fixes
```

Check typings:

```
uv run mypy
```

## 5. Verify Tests Again

Ensure tests still pass after linting and type fixes:

```
uv run py.test
```

## 6. Final Commit

Make a final commit with any linting/typing fixes.
Use `@git-commits.mdc` for assistance with commit message standards.

## Development Loop Guidelines

If there are any failures at any step due to your edits, fix them before proceeding to the next step.
